Whuf is a simple app that helps you keep track of who has done awesome stuff for whom.  If something does something awesome for you, visit whuf.me and give them credit!  It's a system inspired by Cory Doctorow's book "Down And Out In The Magic Kingdom.":http://craphound.com/down/?page_id=1625  If used faithfully by a group of people, I believe a system of this sort could inspire a sort of altruism arms race, in which folks endeavour to be nice to each other above all else.
